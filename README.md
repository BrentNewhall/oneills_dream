# O'Neill's Dream

This is a simple RTS game where you use collector drones to mine resources
from asteroids and use those to build space colonies.

This game was made by [Brent P. Newhall](http://brentnewhall.com) as part of his
[Game a Week challenge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brents-portfolio/index.html).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

on [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org). The "build colony" icon is from
