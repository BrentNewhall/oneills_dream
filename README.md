# O'Neill's Dream

This is a simple RTS game where you use collector drones to mine resources
from asteroids and use those to build space colonies.

This game was made by [Brent P. Newhall](http://brentnewhall.com) as part of his
[Game a Week challenge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brents-portfolio/index.html).

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Resources

The collector ship and asteroid are from
[Space Shooter Assets](https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-assets)
on [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org). The "build colony" icon is
[Defense satellite icon](https://game-icons.net/delapouite/originals/defense-satellite.html)
from [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net). The space background is a public
domain image from NASA. I drew the blue targeting reticule and the space colony
myself in GIMP.
