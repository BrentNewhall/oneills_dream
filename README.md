# O'Neill's Dream

This is a simple RTS game where you use collector drones to mine resources
from asteroids and use those to build space colonies.

This game was made by [Brent P. Newhall](http://brentnewhall.com).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Resources

The collector ship and asteroid are from
[Space Shooter Assets](https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-assets)
on [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org). The space background is a public
domain image from NASA. I drew the blue targeting reticule myself in GIMP.
